* Responsive Popup Lightbox, by clicking on each project you will open a window, which will include the photos and description of that project, presented through sliders. The most important advantage is that your user can pass the next project without closing the lightbox. 
* Lazy Loading, this function is so important to keep the speed of your page. It gives a chance to load the photos only after opening the page. We have been included it in plugin, taking into consideration the fact that portfolio can contain photos with too much quantity. 
* Thumbnail size option, this parameter is also for the speed of the page, as in the view the photos are smaller than their real sizes it will be productive to use this function in order to open photos with small sizes and to load quickly. 
* Attributes, this section is for adding other information, e.g. the author of the project, date, duration, cost, size etc. Attributes have separate types; text, url, date, email etc. This section is separate and you should add the attribute only once, not in each project. 
* Settings, many options give an opportunity to manage separate portfolios and the portfolio of the projects.

= Who needs this plugin? =

This plugin is almost for all companies and freelancers. It is very beautiful and can present IT Company's portfolio, photographer's portfolio, artist's portfolio, freelancer's portfolio, personal portfolio, company portfolio etc. 
If you have many works and put an effort for making those works maximal beautiful and quality, it means now it is the right moment to present your works in a beautiful and unique way. You can present different works through separate portfolios which will make your experience richer and meaningful. In the same time you will get a chance to present each work detailed enough, as all photos and details are presented in a tidy way through lightbox. We solved that problem to present big quantity works by using minimal space. 
It is not a secret that the best way for attracting new customers is the previous works and our plugin can provide the performance of those works. 

= How is our plugin differed? =

At first it is too easy to use our plugin, in the same time we keep you away from wasting time by grouping and distributing different parameters. As an IT Company we also had bad experiences to present our works or our customers' works and during the writing of this plugin we took into consideration all problems that our customers can meet. One of the most important advantages is the speed which will be provided through Lazy Loading and Thumbnail size options. As well the Custom attributes tab makes the plugin flexible and provides more time for admin.
